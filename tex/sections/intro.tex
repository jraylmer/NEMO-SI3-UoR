\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document gives instructions for compiling and running the \SIcu{} sea ice model on the Reading Academic Computing Cluster (RACC).
By following the instructions in Sections~\ref{sec:download} to \ref{sec:forcings}, the reader will end up with a configuration of \SIcu{} coupled to the NEMO ocean model and forced by multi-year atmospheric forcing files.
By continuing through Sections~\ref{sec:sas} and \ref{sec:mlm}, the reader will learn how to replace the full ocean model with a simpler mixed-layer ocean model.
Section~\ref{sec:restarts} (which is independent of Sections~\ref{sec:sas} and \ref{sec:mlm}) describes how to run \SIcu{} with initial conditions taken from restart files saved by a previous run.

Copies of various files to support running \SIcu{} on the RACC have been placed under \verb|/storage/silver/cpom/rk901985/SI3RACC|.
In what follows, paths beginning \verb|SI3RACC| refer to this directory.

\SIcu{} is part of the NEMO ocean modelling framework.
The main technical website for NEMO is its GitLab site at \verb|https://forge.nemo-ocean.eu|.
This supersedes the old Trac site at \verb|http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/nemo|.
At the GitLab site, the source code of NEMO-\SIcu{} can be browsed and a link can be found to a manual for the ocean part of NEMO \citep{nemo-4.2.0}.
An up-to-date manual for \SIcu{} has been promised, but at the time of writing has yet to appear.
Until then, one has to make do with the older, incomplete manual that can be found via the old Trac site \citep{si3-4.0.1}.
For convenience, copies of both manuals have been placed under \verb|SI3RACC/Downloads/NEMO| as the files \verb|NEMO_manual_4.2.0.pdf| and \verb|SI3_manual.pdf|.
