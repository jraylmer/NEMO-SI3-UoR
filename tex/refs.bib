@comment The following entries for NEMO manuals include all the
@comment information in the model citations given at the start of the
@comment manuals themselves. I've added the missing authors from
@comment doc/rst/source/ref.bib in the NEMO source (trunk downloaded
@comment 17/4/2020 at revision 12764). The BibTeX entries in that
@comment file are best not used directly because they include fields
@comment that are ignored in the Manual entry type, even in natbib's
@comment extended styles (series, number, doi).  They also lack the
@comment ISSN.  Strangely, although natbib adds support for issn and
@comment doi fields, its style files ignore them in the Manual
@comment document type. I've therefore had to cram a lot of
@comment information into the notes field.

@comment For the latest manual NEMO v5.0 I have just included the
@comment fields as suggested by the citation format in the manual
@comment For the latest SI3 manual (which is v4.2, still not updated)
@comment the preferred citation style is not clear in the manual.
